# Swedish Thesis Ignition Table

Also not much details about this map. But unique bonus to this one is that this map actually comes with a VE Table as well.

Made in Sweden. A must try.

Jokes aside. As not much is known of this table. Use with caution. For all we know, the engine used for this tune might be built.

Originally this map was even wider than the maximum 16x16 table. Cropped to be used in a 16x16 grid.

## Details
- None
- Maybe stock B230 FK/FT?

## Tips when using this table
- Drop a few degrees of this table before using for the first time
- Using a knock sensor is strongly recommended
- Set boost limit to 200 kPA for testing and raising to 250 kPA when testing is successful
- Try to use allong with the co-made VE table
