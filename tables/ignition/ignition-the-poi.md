# The Poi's Ignition Table

This is a weird one. Starting at 1000 RPM, it looks like this is meant to be calibrated for top end use, rather then idling.

This table is not on my TOP list to be used right off the bat. But still worth testing.

12x12 table converted to 16x16.
An odd convertion to be honest.

## Details
- Run up to 240 kPA
- Little ping but not at high RPM and boost
- B230FT
- IPD Turbo cam
- Not tested by anyone else

## Tips when using this table
- Drop a good couple of degrees of this table before using for the first time
- Using a knock sensor is strongly recommended
- Set boost limit to 200 kPA for testing and raising to 250 kPA when testing is successful
