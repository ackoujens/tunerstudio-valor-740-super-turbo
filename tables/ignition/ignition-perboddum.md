# Perboddum's Ignition Table

Not much details are known about this map.
The user himself has been running this map for 3 years. But in my honest opinion, looks very rough/basic.

This is a Turbobricks ignition table.
Originally made for 12x12, converted to be used in a 16x16 grid.

## Details
- 940 B230FT

## Tips when using this table
- Drop a few degrees of this table before using for the first time
- Using a knock sensor is strongly recommended
- Set boost limit to 200 kPA for testing and raising to 250 kPA when testing is successful
- Use this map when wanting to test something really basic, maybe good for starting point when all else fails
