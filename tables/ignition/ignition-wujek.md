# Wujek's Ignition Table

Found on Turbobricks.

User told he quickly created this table.
Because of this I'm not as keen of trying this one out.

## Details
- Quick map
- 2.3L
- 8v
- D camshaft
- 20T @ 1.7bar
- 3" downpipe
- 531 head
- Bigger valves
- 440 cm3 injectors

## Tips when using this table
- Make sure your build somewhat matches the specs in the details section
- Using a knock sensor is strongly recommended
- Set boost limit to 200 kPA for testing and raising to 250 kPA when testing is successful

## Notes
- Not much use for stock engines
- Less trustworhy because of quick build
- Table has not been tested by me and probably wont be because my specs deviate too much
