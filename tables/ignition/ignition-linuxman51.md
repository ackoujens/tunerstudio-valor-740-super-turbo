# Linuxman51's Ignition Table

Linuxman51 has been helping out others by sharing this map. Only positive experiences from other users have been heard. No major complaints.

Only minor comment I've caught is that some people noticed some pinging around 3/4K. Nothing a bit of quality pump gas can solve, raising the octane rating.

98 octane fuel is more commenly available around the EU. I find a lot of US maps are based around 92/93.

This is a Turbobricks ignition table.
Originally made for 12x12, converted to be used in a 16x16 grid.

## Details
- Stock turbo car
- Tuned from 6 psi - 14.7 psi
- 93 octane pump gas
- Few people used with success
- 2Â° every 1K works well
- T camshaft (turbo)
- 13C turbo (unported)

## Tips when using this table
- Drop a few degrees of this table before using for the first time
- Using a knock sensor is strongly recommended
- Set boost limit to 200 kPA for testing and raising to 250 kPA when testing is successful
- Seems most fitting for stock B230FK/FT
